# Dreams and Machines for Foundry VTT

Dreams and Machines is a brand new RPG setting where people come together to rebuild their world following a catastrophic war. You will venture into a world of mystery and adventure, a world where slumbering mechs dot the landscape and people build their lives anew in the wreckage of paradise. Take on the role of one of the new tribes of humanity, an Archivist, Dreamer, Everan, River, or Spear, and forge a path for yourself and your people.

### FontAwesome

> **License:** [Proprietary](https://fontawesome.com/license)
>
> There are a couple of important nuances to use of FontAwesome in this project.
>
> 1. The official FoundryVTT has a license to use and distribute FontAwesome Pro icons within their software. To my knowledge and based on information shared in the [FoundryVTT Discord Server](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt), this **_does not_** include systems developed for Foundry by third-party creators.
> 2. This system makes use of the FontAwesome Pro icons packaged with Foundry VTT. _This is allowable only because I have a FontAwesome Pro license._ No other seats are provided for contributors at this time.
>
> This means:
>
> 1. Contributors should not make use of FontAwesome Pro icons in the code they contribute to the project (because FontAwesome licenses are based on individual seats) unless they have a seat on a FontAwesome Pro license.
> 2. If you fork this project, you are responsible for either removing all uses of FontAwesome Pro icons, or purchasing an appropriate license.
